you create the Dockerfile and define the steps that build up your images
you issue the docker build command which will build a Docker image from your Dockerfile
now you can use this image to start containers with the docker run command

# Create and deploy to swarm
docker swarm init
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml myapp

# to run myapp as an application
docker-compose up --build
